This directory is to simulate images from camera sensing through the ISP to JPEG compression (before it is stored in memory). This is work-in-progress. 

Code will be in C++, and we will have two models per module, a C++ implementation that performs the image processing function, and a higher level model that simulates the energy efficiency for this processing (simple abstract model). Maybe later we will add C-> RTL implementations for hardware as we start to approximate things.
